MODULE: ConnectPins
-------

DESCRIPTION:
------------
The ConnectPins module allows you to control your switch
matrix. You can connect the instrument terminals to one or
more DUT pins. If the DUT pin number is less than 1, then
that connection is ignored (not performed), otherwise the
specified instrument is connected to the desired DUT pin.
If you wish to connect an instrument to more than one DUT
pin, you may specify that instrument terminal again in the
parameter list.

If the OpenAll parameter is 1, then all previous matrix
connections are cleared before making the new connections.
If the OpenAll parameter is 0 (zero), then NO matrix
connections are cleared before making new connections.


INPUTS:
-------
OpenAll           (int) A flag that controls whether the
                  switch matrix is first cleared before
                  making any new connections. If this
                  parameter is set to 1, then all previous
                  connections are cleared, otherwise they
                  are left intact. Valid inputs: 0 or 1

TermIdStr1 -      (char *) The terminal identification string.
TermIdStr8        This refers to a instrument as defined
                  by KCON. Valid inputs (configuration
                  dependent) are: SMUn, CMTRn, CMTRnL, PGUn,
                  GPIn, GPInL, GNDU (where n is number from 1
                  through 8).

Pin1 - Pin8      (int) The DUT pin number (configuration
                 dependent) to which the instrument will
                 be attached. If a number less than 1 is
                 specified, then no connection will be made.
                 Valid inputs: -1 to 72.


OUTPUTS:
--------
-none-


RETURN VALUES:
--------------
0           OK.

-10000      (INVAL_INST_ID) An invalid instrument ID was
            specified. This generally means that there is
            no instrument with the specified ID in your
            configuration.

-10001      (INVAL_PIN_SPEC) An invalid DUT pin number
            was specified.

-10003      (NO_SWITCH_MATRIX) No switch matrix was found.

-10004      (NO_MATRIX_CARDS) No matrix cards were found.


EXAMPLE:
--------
To connect SMU1 to pin 7, SMU2 to pin 8, SMU3 to pin 12,
SMU4 to pin 1, ground pin 15, connect the pulse generator
to pin 13, connect the CMTR to pins 9 and 10, and clear the
previous connections:

    ConnectPins(1, SMU1, 7, SMU2, 8, SMU3, 12, SMU4, 1, GNDU, 15
    PGU1, 13, CMTR1, 9, CMTR1L, 10)
